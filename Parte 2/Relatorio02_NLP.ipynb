            "The appropriate immune microenvironment plays crucial roles in bone regeneration. Surface structure and chemistry are key factors affecting immune cells behavior and subsequently regulating the activity of bonerelated cells. To achieve rapid osteointegration, this study prepared a biomimetic calcium phosphate (CaP) coating on Ti-based substrates (THCaP) with the help of oleic acid under hydrothermal condition. The coating was composed of hydroxyapatite nanowires and further self-assembled into micropores. Also, the effect of the biomimetic CaP coating on the immune response of macrophages and the impact on angiogenesis and osteogenesis were investigated. In vitro cell culture results showed that compared with pristine Ti and similar titanate nanowire structure (TH), THCaP not only stimulated the polarization of macrophages towards a pro-healing M2 phenotype, but also enhanced the angiogenic and osteogenic differentiation of endothelial cells and preosteoblastic cells, respectively. Particularly, macrophages on THCaP induced a favorable immune microenvironment that facilitated osteogenic differentiation of pre-osteoblastic cells. In vivo tests confirmed these findings, showing that the implanted THCaP could suppress the inflammatory response and facilitate new bone formation when compared with pristine Ti and TH implants. These results indicate that preparation of biomimetic CaP network structure is a promising approach to surface design of Ti-based substrates, which is beneficial to generate a favorable osteoimmunomodulatory microenvironment for enhancing osteointegration.\n"

The development in Poisson's ratio and elastic moduli parameters (bulk, Young's, shear, and longitudinal) of the heavier CaO content of the PNC-glasses were proved through Makishima-Mackenzie (M-M) and bond compression (B-C) models. The B-C bulk elastic (KB-C) modulus was found to raise from 71.4 to 95.16 GPa, while the M-M bulk (KM-M) modulus was increased from 22.48 to 40.75 GPa for PNC-0 (glass sample free with CaO) and PNC-55 (glass sample rich with CaO), respectively. The highest mass attenuation coefficient (MAC) values were reported for PNC-55 sample, whereas the lowest were reported for PNC-0 sample. Half value layer (HVL) values were reported as 1.6526 cm, 1.6181 cm, 1.5734 cm, 1.5275 cm, 1.4847 cm, 1.441 cm, and 1.4172 cm for PNC-0, PNC-10, PNC-20, PNC-30, PNC-40, PNC-50, and PNC-55 samples at 0.1 MeV, respectively. The effective atomic numbers (Z(eff)) were reported as 10.2658, 10.4393, 10.6149, 10.7924, 10.9719, 11.1536, and 11.2451 for PNC-0, PNC-10, PNC-20, PNC-30, PNC-40, PNC-50, and PNC-55 samples at 0.1 MeV, respectively. The PNC-55 sample was reported with a maximum value of effective atomic weight for absorption (A(eff)). The lowest exposure and energy absorption buildup factors (EBF and EABF) values were discovered for the PNC-55 sample, while the highest EBF values were found for the pure PNC-0 sample. Finally, one can conclude that the PNC-55 is a superior for gamma-ray attenuation competencies.\n",

            "This study introduces microbiologically induced calcium phosphate precipitation (MICPP) as a novel and environmentally sustainable method of soil stabilization. Using Limosilactobacillus sp., especially NBRC 14511 and fish bone solution (FBS) extracted from Tuna fish bones, the study was aimed at testing the feasibility of calcium phosphate compounds (CPCs) deposition and sand stabilization. Dynamic changes in pH and calcium ion (Ca2+) concentration during the precipitation experiments affected the precipitation and sequential conversion of dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) to hydroxyapatite (HAp), which was confirmed by XRD and SEM analysis. Sand solidification experiments demonstrated improvements in unconfined compressive strength (UCS), especially at higher Urea/Ca2+ ratios. The UCS values obtained were 10.35 MPa at a ratio of 2.0, 3.34 MPa at a ratio of 1.0, and 0.43 MPa at a ratio of 0.5, highlighting the advantages of MICPP over traditional methods. Microstructural analysis further clarified the mineral composition, demonstrating the potential of MICPP in environmentally friendly soil engineering. The study highlights the promise of MICPP for sustainable soil stabilization, offering improved mechanical properties and reducing environmental impact, paving the way for novel geotechnical practices.\n"

            "Implant devices are prone to a substantial risk of infection, which can result in serious health issues with an increased number of fatalities sometimes. Numerous studies have demonstrated that calcium phosphate-based materials exhibit enhanced bone integration when subjected to electrical polarization through an external electric field prior to implantation The present work focuses on examining the impact of electrical polarization on a biphasic calcium phosphate consisting of 40% hydroxyapatite and 60% beta-tricalcium phosphate. To evaluate the osteogenicity and anti-bacterial efficacy, two types of specimens such as (i) that was not subjected to poling but were doped with silver nanoparticles, and (ii) that underwent poling without doping. Comprehensive examinations utilizing X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were used to assess the crystallinity and purity of the phase and to observe the cell morphology. The Thermally Stimulated Depolarization Current measurement of polarised biphasic calcium phosphate demonstrated the highest current density of 4.06 mu C/cm2, and it showed significant hydrophilicity with low contact angles. The silver nanoparticle-doped biphasic calcium phosphate showed improved bacterial viability, although it exhibited cytotoxicity effects. In contrast, the cell viability of the specimens demonstrated that polarised biphasic calcium phosphate has the potential to reduce bacteria and promote the development and survival of osteoblast cells. Hence, the present work indicates that polarised biphasic calcium phosphate may be a superior choice in comparison to silver nanoparticle-doped biphasic calcium phosphate.\n"

            "Zinc (Zn) alloys provide a new generation for orthopedic applications due to their essential physiological effects and promising degradation properties. However, excessive release of Zn ions (Zn2+) during degradation and the severe inflammatory microenvironment are not conducive to osseointegration, which is determined by the characteristics of the implant surface. Therefore, it is essential to modulate the release rate of Zn alloys by surface modification technology and endow them with anti-inflammatory and osteogenic effects. In this study, two kinds of phosphate chemical conversion (PCC) coatings with different compositions and morphological structures are prepared, namely Zn-P (with disk-like crystals) and Ca-Zn-P (with lamellar crystals). Although all the PCC-coated Zn implants have low cytotoxicity, Ca-Zn-P show better osteoimmunomodulation effects in several aspects: the induction of the M2-phenotype macrophage polarization and thus promotion of osteogenesis in vitro; the regulation of the bone immune microenvironment which is conducive to tissue regeneration and osseointegration in vivo; and the release of ions (through PI3K/AKT and Wnt signaling pathways) and the morphological structures (through RhoGTPase signaling pathways) act as possible mechanisms of M2 polarization. The Ca-Zn-P coating can be considered to provide new insights into bone immunomodulation and osseointegration.\n"

            "Hopeite (Zn3(PO4)24H2O) coatings, fabricated via zinc phosphate chemical conversion (ZPCC), have attracted considerable interest in biomedical applications owing to their excellent corrosion resistance and biocompatibility. However, the influence of calcium nitrate (CN) on coating properties remains poorly understood. This study systematically investigates the effect of CN concentration on the microstructure and corrosion behavior of ZPCC coatings deposited on stainless steel (SS). The phase composition, surface morphology, and elemental distribution were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Electrochemical corrosion performance was assessed via potentiodynamic polarization in a 0.9 wt.% NaCl solution. The results indicate that CN concentration critically influences coating morphology, with higher concentrations leading to reduced crystal size and increased coating mass. Notably, the coating prepared with 6 g/L CN exhibited a dense, uniform, and fine-grained microstructure, resulting in superior corrosion resistance. Additionally, the optimized coating demonstrated strong interfacial adhesion, with a shear strength of 10.05 +/- 1.2 MPa.\n"

            "The present work reports the development of novel ternary silver-silver phosphate-biphasic calcium phosphate nanocomposites by plant-extract mediated hydrothermal route. Unique epitaxial morphological growth of the Ag-Ag3PO4 core-shell structure influences the internal grain-grain boundary arrangement. The green-assisted development of the constituent phases helps significant biocompatibility enhancement (-89-93% for 50 mu g/ mL; 72 h). Hence long-term bone-replacement purposes and polar fluid osmosis are favorable due to higher cell attachment on the rough surface of the mesoporous nanocomposites. The heterogeneous attachment between the three phases creates defect states indicating intense interfacial polarization, as elucidated by the dielectric spectroscopic studies. The surface charge essential for bone regeneration is likely to be developed. Besides, the porous nanocomposite compacts exhibit superior phase-composition-dependent mechanical (Hardness-1.3 GPa; load 4.9 N) and dielectric properties (permittivity-1.2 x 103; 200 Hz, 613 K) helping in conduction through bones.

            "Calcium phosphate (CaP) formation under piezoelectric stimulation in vitro is investigated in this paper. Crystallized ZnO was synthesized hydrothermally on Ti-6Al-4 V pieces. The piezoelectric coefficient d(33) was measured and found in the range of 2.1-3.7 pC/N. Tests of immersing ZnO/Ti sample in a flow-simulated body fluid under sonic stimulation were carried out. Different sonic excitation times (0.17 similar to 3 min) were set to assess the effect of excitation level. The results show that sphere-shaped CaP can be observed on the SEM photographs of excited and no-excited samples. The difference is aggregated CaP formed on excited samples, but not on no-excited. The effect of the excitation time on the shape of CaP is not obvious. The CaP formation on the electroconductive pasted samples shows the connection of aggregated CaP coat due to piezoelectric stimulation. More Ca and P contents in the CaP precipitate on acoustic excited sample than no-excited one were found. The crystallinity of CaP was found increased by the piezoelectric stimulation. We conclude that the sonic-stimulated piezoelectricity promotes electrical attraction between CaP clusters. It also promotes crystallization of the CaP during precipitation.\n",

            "A sintering-free magnesium phosphate cement (MPC) with an arbitrary shape is potentially used as a bone implant material, especially with complex shapes. However, the high degradation rate of MPC may lead to the degradation of mechanical properties. In this study, graphene (G)/barium titanate (BT)/MPC composites were fabricated by introducing the piezoelectric phase BT and conducive phase G into MPC, which exhibited the piezoelectric effect after polarisation. The negative surface of the composite may attract Ca2+ and Mg2+ to mineralise rapidly, thereby reducing and improving its degradation rate and mechanical properties, respectively. The contents of additional G and BT were optimised. When BT and G contents were 50 mol% and 0.5 wt%, respectively, the piezoelectric coefficient of the composites increased to 6.31 pC/N, which is an increase of 421% without the addition of G. The results of in vitro degradation and mineralisation in simulated body fluids (SBF) showed that introducing BT and G could effectively slow down the degradation rate, promote mineralisation on the composite surface, and enhance the impact on bone integration.\n"

Phase composition and corrosion behavior of the as-deposited coatings were studied. Results showed that the calcium phosphate coatings had a grass-like structure. As the duty cycle increased, phase composition of the coatings changed from hydroxyapatite (HA) to mixture of HA and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD). The adhesion of strength between the coatings and the substrate were higher than 10 MPa. Potentiodynamic polarization test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy test in simulated body fluid (SBF) indicated that the samples deposited with calcium phosphate coatings exhibited better corrosion resistance as compared with the bare AZ91 alloy.

Two different compression modes were used: a) hold mode: once the maximum load was reached, it was kept applied to the sample during 5 min, and b) release mode: the maximum load was removed rapidly while the electrical signal was recorded during 5 min. In all cases the piezoelectric voltages reduces exponentially to zero with different characteristic times and voltage amplitudes, depending on the compression mode and the calcium concentration. The samples were also characterized using: X-Ray Diffraction, Dielectric Relaxation Spectroscopy and mechanical test.\n",

            "Piezoelectric eco-friendly wafers have extensive applications in areas like automotive, military, medical and aerospace. High dense wafers based on barium titanate solid solution having composition 0.5(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3-0.5Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O-3 were fabricated by tape casting technique using phosphate ester as dispersant. The sintering conditions and poling parameters were optimized to achieve enhanced dielectric, ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties. Maximum relative permittivity and low loss (epsilon(r) = 4400 and tan delta < 0.06 at 1 kHz), polarization (P-max = 14 A mu C/cm(2), P-r = 7.8 A mu C/cm(2) at 20 kV/cm) was achieved with wafers having highest density (5.6 gm/cc) obtained by application of top load of 0.9 gm/cm(2) and sintered at 1500 A degrees C for 2 h. Further the wafers were poled at the optimized poling conditions i.e. at 40 A degrees C temperature for duration of 30 min and application of field of 3E(c) to obtain maximum piezoelectric coefficient (d(33) = 209 pc/N). The fatigue behavior was investigated by application of bipolar electric field upto 10(4) cycles at 1 Hz. The wafers exhibited almost fatigue free behavior which confirms the possibility of application of these materials in ferroelectric based devices.\n",

            "In this work, a calcium-phosphate glass-ceramics was successfully obtained by heat treatment of a mixture of 26.52 in wt.% of fluorapatite (Fap) and 73.48 in wt.% of 77S (77 SiO2-14 CaO-9P(2)O(5) in wt.%) gel. The calcium phosphate-glass-ceramics was prepared by sol-gel process with tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), triethyl phosphate (TEP), calcium nitrate and fluorapatite. The synthesized powders were characterized by some commonly used tools such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), P-31 magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and thin-film X-ray diffraction (TF-XRD). The obtained results seemed to confirm the nucleation and growth of hydroxyapatite (Hap) nano-phase in the glass. Moreover, an in-vitro evaluation of the glass-ceramic was performed. In addition, to assess its bioactive capacity, it was soaked in simulated body fluid (SBF) at different time intervals. The SEM, EDS and TF-XRD analyses showed the deposition of hydroxyapatite on the surface of the specimens after three days of immersion in SBF solution. The mechanical properties of the obtained material such as rupture strength, Vickers hardness and elastic modulus were measured. In addition, the friction coefficient of calcium phosphate-glass-ceramics was tested. The values of the composite of rupture strength (24 MPa), Vickers hardness (214 Hv), Young's modulus (523 GPa), shear modulus (19 GPa) and friction coefficient (0.327) were obtained. This glass-ceramics can have useful applications in dental prostheses. Indeed, this material may have promising applications for implants because of its content of fluorine, the effective protector against dental caries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n"

            "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to show through enamel remineralization that a combination of casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) and fluoride is better than fluoride alone when the processing time for remineralization is short. Methods: The bovine enamel slobs (N=28) were subjected to pH cycling for 4 days. Paste containing CPP-ACP and/or fluoride was applied for 30 minutes daily. The sections were observed using a polarizing microscope and microradiographs. Results: In the groups treated solely with sodium fluoride (NaF) solution, tissue loss on the enamel surface was observed. On the other hand, in the groups that had been treated with a mixture of the NaF solution and CPP-ACP, the enamel surface was maintained. Conclusions: These results show that casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate-containing poste has the ability to maintain the enamel surface; the combined use of CPP-ACP paste and fluoride enhances this ability, thereby reducing demineralization.

            "The quality factor along with electromechanical coupling coefficient (CEMC) is commonly used as a measure of the energy efficiency of a piezoelectric transducer (PT) working as an energy converter. Losses in piezo-ceramics are phenomenologically considered to have three coupled mechanisms: dielectric, elastic, and piezoelectric. Their cumulative performance first of all determines the PT quality factor characterizing the efficiency of vibrational energy accumulation, and related to it dissipative effects.The extended definition of the PT electromechanical quality factor (EMQ) with permanent energy exchange between electrical source of excitation and PT was proposed. The EMQ analysis has been conducted on the basis of complex material constants for both stiffened and unstiffened canonical vibrational modes. The efficiency of mechanically free and electrically excited piezoceramic transducers in a wide frequency range of PT harmonics, especially between the fundamental resonance and antiresonance frequencies, was investigated, and the effect of piezoelectric loss anomaly with extremely low total losses was predicted. Particularly, optimization of PT excitation with connected reactive (capacitive) element was conducted to provide higher PT mechanical vibrational characteristics with less total losses. The requirements to the piezoceramic material parameters, types of transducer vibrations, and especially to the piezoelectric loss factor in the range of physically valid values were established to provide maximal EMQ.\n"

            "In this study, an attempt was made to improve the packing density of calcium phosphate (CaP) coating on a magnesium alloy by tailoring the coating solution for enhanced degradation resistance of the alloy for implant applications. An organic solvent, ethanol, was added to the coating solution to decrease the conductivity of the coating solution so that hydrogen bubble formation/bursting reduces during the CaP coating process. Experimental results confirmed that ethanol addition to the coating solution reduces the conductivity of the solution and also decreases the hydrogen evolution/bubble bursting. In vitro electrochemical experiments, that is, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization showed that CaP coating produced in 30% (v/v) ethanol containing coating solution (3E) exhibits significantly higher degradation resistance (i.e., approximate to 50% higher polarization resistance and approximate to 60% lower corrosion current) than the aqueous solution coating. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis of the coatings revealed that the packing of 3E coating was denser than that of aqueous coating, which can be attributed to the lower hydrogen evolution in the former than in the latter. Further increase in the ethanol content in the coating solution was not beneficial; in fact, the coating produced in 70% (v/v) ethanol containing solution (7E) showed degradation resistance much inferior to that of the aqueous coating, which is due to low thickness of 7E coating.

            "Aim of this study was to combine the well-known biocompatibility and ostoeconductivity of thin calcium phosphate coatings on titanium with proangiogenic signals from codeposited copper species. Copper species could be integrated in mineral layers based on hydroxyapatite by means of electrochemically assisted deposition from electrolytes containing calcium, phosphate, and copper ions. Different combinations of duration and intensity of galvanostatic pulses result in different amounts of deposited calcium phosphate and of copper species even for the same applied total charge. Absolute amounts of copper varied between 2.1 and 6.9 g/cm(2), and the copper was distributed homogeneously as shown by EDX mapping. The presence of copper did not change the crystalline phase of deposited calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite) but provoked a significant decrease in deposited amounts by factor 3 to 4. The copper was deposited mainly as Cu(I) species with a minor fraction of basic copper phosphates. Reduction of copper occurred not only at the surface of titanium but also within the hydroxyapatite coating due to the reaction with hydrogen produced by the electrolysis of water during the cathodic polarization of the substrate.

            "In spite of having excellent biocompatibility and osteogenic property of hydroxyapatite (HAp) and beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP), concerns have been raised regarding their degradation kinetics. Complete in vivo degradation of HAp takes years because of its slow degradation rate, and fast degradation rate of beta-TCP limits its application. Biphasic calcium phosphates (BCPs) composed of both HAp and beta-TCP have controlled degradation to some extent. Here, we have prepared three different BCPs composed of beta-TCP and HAp. These BCP composites are successfully electrically polarized to generate surfaces with positive (P-poled) and negative (N-poled) charges. Thermally stimulated depolarized current measurement (TSDC) exhibits increased stored charge density with the increase in HAp percentage in the composites. Our study focuses on understanding the effect of composition variation as well as electrical polarization of these composites on early stage osteoblast-cell adhesion, proliferation, and extracellular matrix (ECM) formation capability. No matter what the composition is, N-poled (Negatively poled) surfaces show early stage osteoblast-cell adhesion, proliferation, and ECM formation when compared with U-poled (unpoled) and P-poled (positively poled) surfaces. Irrespective of the surface charge, an improved cell-material interactions are observed as the percentage of HAp content in the composites is increased. These electrically polarized BCP composites can have potential use in the area of orthopedics and dentistry. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The aim of this study was to improve the mechanical performance of the calcium phosphate cement by means of particle reduction of the powder components involved. alpha-tricalcium phosphate (alpha-TCP) powder was produced and subsequently reacted with water to form a calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite in the form of a biocompatible and resorbable cement. It was postulated that the reduction of the alpha-TCP particle size would result in a faster-setting reaction and stronger cement. Three milling techniques were explored and their methods optimized. The techniques included the traditional ball-milling technique and two newer techniques, namely cryogenic and planetary milling. Particle size analysis through laser diffraction and scanning electron microscopy was conducted. Compressive strength, setting times and injectability characteristics of the curing cement were determined.It was observed that all three techniques were efficient methods of particle reduction and the mechanical, setting and injectability properties were significantly improved by the reduction in particle size of the alpha-TCP powder. However, agglomerations of alpha-tricalcium phosphate resulted in a reduction in compressive strength and injectability after prolonged milling periods, irrespective of milling technique.\n",

Phase composition, morphology, and mechanical properties - including in-air and in vitro fatigue behavior - were evaluated. Experimental results showed that the chitosan matrix did not affect the crystalline phase of CaP. However, the content of CaP additive affected the three-point bending strength of the composites. A CaP/chitosan ratio of 5% by mass to volume in the composite achieved the significantly highest bending strength of 45.7 MPa. Stability of chitosan/CaP hybrid composites was apparently affected by in vitro cyclic loading. Nonetheless, when applied a loading stress of 11.4 MPa, the sample containing the optimal 5 mass/vol% CaP lasted 40 minutes in in vitro fatigue test until failure occurred. It was thus concluded that hybrid biocomposites with initial high strength might be a potential implant candidate for bone defect repair.\n",

            "ReCa4O(BO3)(3) oxyborate crystals (ReCOB, where Re is a rare earth element such as Gd) were grown using the Czochralski pulling technique. The crystals belong to C-m space group and the relationships of the as-grown crystal morphology with crystallographic and physical coordinates were determined. The optimum length extensional and thickness shear vibrations of GdCOB were found for (ZYl)40 degrees and (YXt)33 degrees cuts, with electromechanical coupling factors k(32) and k(26), being on the order of 17.5% and 25% and piezoelectric coefficients d(32) and d(26) around -4.5 and 11.7 pC/N, respectively. Of particular significance is the nearly temperature independent behavior up to >1000 degrees C. Together with its high resistivity (similar to 5 x 10(6) Omega cm at 1000 degrees C ) and high mechanical quality factor (similar to 4000 at 1000 degrees C ) make GdCOB and/or ReCOB crystals promising candidates for the next generation sensing applications at ultrahigh temperature (>1000 degrees C ).

            "A retrospective study was done on the nature and degree of crystalluria in spontaneously voided fasting and postprandial urine of patients with recurrent idiopathic calcium urolithiasis (RCU) divided into normocalciuria (20 males, 20 females) and hypercalciuria patients (20 males, 20 females), and controls (20 males, 20 females). The crystals were obtained using a filter technique and identified by microscopy. In addition, individual data, clinical chemistry variables and indices reflecting the risk of calcium phosphate and calcium oxalate crystallization were evaluated. In contrast to findings of other investigators of crystalluria we observed only a few crystals on the filters. The most frequently occurring phases were (in this order) a urate-containing phase (tentatively termed uric), an amorphous calcium phosphate phase (tentatively termed isotropic) and a phase of spheroid-like particles, not yet definitely characterized (tentatively termed spheroid). Calcium oxalate crystals were found only exceptionally. There was no relationship between the degree of calciuria (normo- versus hypercalciuric RCU) and crystalluria. Among RCU, males generally had a predominance of the isotropic, females of the spheroid phase, as compared with controls. Also, RCU females were generally obese, and their spheroid score and lean body mass correlated negatively and significantly. The calcium phosphate and calcium oxalate risk indices were always low in normal individuals, higher in RCU. Patients of both sexes with urinary stones had normal parathyroid gland function, but higher total calcium in fasting serum and higher urinary pH as compared with controls. From these data we concluded that (1) crystalluria is a regular finding in human urine, but is more pronounced in RCU; (2) in males, the isotropic phase, in terms of frequency and its score, may be causally related to the development of urolithiasis; (3) the spheroid phase, more frequently observed in RCU females, may reflect an as yet unknown metobolic disorder; (4) the rareness of calcium oxalate crystals despite a high calcium oxalate risk index suggests that such crystals may be adherent to upstream tissue.\n",

            "The mechanical of the tricalcium phosphate matrix sintered with different amounts of the magnesium oxide have been investigated. The tricalcium phosphate - magnesium oxide composites were characterized by using the mechanical properties such as rupture strength, Vickers hardness and elastic modulus. The effects of the sintering process on the structural changes of the composites were investigated. At 1300 degrees C, the highest performance was obtained for the tricalcium phosphate containing 5 wt% MgO. The maximum mechanical strength and Young's modulus of the composites reached 9 MPa and 38 GPa, respectively. The result can be explained by the formation of both, liquid phase, which helps to fill the pores in the microstructure, and a new phase relative to the calcium magnesium phosphate. At 1400 degrees C and beyond 5 wt% MgO, the performances of the composites are hindered by the intragranular porosity formation and by the exaggerated grain growth. The addition of the magnesium oxide to the tricalcium phosphate matrix promotes the reduction of the wear rate and the friction coefficient. The composites performances are close to the enamel.\n",

            "The osteoimmunology has revealed that immune system plays an important role in maintaining bone metabolism and remodeling. As long-term physiological factor in bone, mechanical stimulation such as micro-vibration stimulation (MVS) exerts effects on regulating osteogenesis and immune response. In this study, the osteo-immunodulatory effects of bicalcium phosphate (BCP) ceramics coupled with MVS are investigated. This results find that the combination of BCP ceramics and MVS may exert synergistic effects on the polarization and functional status of macrophages through activating plasma membrance Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA) channel, reducing the intracellular calcium ion concentration, and inhibiting downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 signaling pathway. BCP ceramics coupled MVS could drive the macrophage polarization to wound-healing M2 phenotype to decrease the production of pro-inflammatory factors, enhance the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2. Moreover, BCP and MVS-modulated macrophage secretion pattern can trigger the BMP/TGF-Smad signaling pathways to induce osteoblastic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) in vitro, and maintain cellular viability and promote the formation of collagen-rich osteoid like tissues and mature blood vessels in vivo. This study demonstrates that the introduction of mechanical stimuli like non-invasive MVS is an effective strategy to improve bone repair effects of biomaterials through endowing them with superior osteo-immunodulatory capacity.\n",

Its physical and mechanical properties, such as compressive strength, initial and final setting times, cohesion time, dough time, swelling time, dimensional and thermal behavior, and injectability were investigated by varying different parameters such as liquid to powder (LIP) ratio (0.35-0.7 ml g(-1)), molar calcium to phosphate (Ca/P) ratio (1.67-2.5) and the pH (4, 7, and 9) and the concentration (0-1 M) of the sodium phosphate buffer. The best results were obtained with the pH 7 sodium phosphate buffer at the concentration of 0.75 M. With this liquid phase, physical and mechanical properties depended on the Call? and UP ratios, varying from 3 to 11 MPa (compressive strength), 6 to 10 min (initial setting time), 11 to 15 min (final setting time), 15 to 30 min (swelling time), 7 to 20 min (time of 100% injectability). The dough or working time was over 16 min. This cement expanded during its setting (1.2-5% according to Ca/P and L/P ratios); this would allow a tight filling. Given the mechanical and rheological properties of this new DCPD/CaO-based cement, its use as root canal sealing material can be considered as classical calcium hydroxide or ZnO/eugenol-based pastes, without or with a gutta-percha point.

In Hanks, E (g) was 3.3-3.4 eV in the inner oxide layer and 2.9 eV in the outer hydroxide layer. In saline, E (g) was 3.3 eV in the inner layer and 2.7 eV in the outer layer.

Thus, electrical stimulations such as pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) and stimuli-responsive piezoelectric properties of scaffolds have been investigated separately to evaluate their efficacy in supporting osteogenesis. However, current understanding of cells responding under the combined influence of PEMF and piezoelectric properties in scaffolds is still lacking. Therefore, in this study, we fabricated piezoelectric scaffolds by functionalization of polycaprolactone-tricalcium phosphate (PCL-TCP) films with a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) coating that is self-polarized by a modified breath-figure technique. The osteoinductive properties of these PVDF-coated PCL-TCP films on MC3T3-E1 cells were studied under the stimulation of PEMF. Piezoelectric and ferroelectric characterization demonstrated that scaffolds with piezoelectric coefficient d(33) = -1.2 pC/N were obtained at a powder dissolution temperature of 100 degrees C and coating relative humidity (RH) of 56%. DNA quantification showed that cell proliferation was significantly enhanced by PEMF as low as 0.6 mT and 50 Hz. Hydroxyapatite staining showed that cell mineralization was significantly enhanced by incorporation of PVDF coating. Gene expression study showed that the combination of PEMF and PVDF coating promoted late osteogenic gene expression marker most significantly. Collectively, our results suggest that the synergistic effects of PEMF and piezoelectric scaffolds on osteogenesis provide a promising alternative strategy for electrically augmented osteoinduction. The piezoelectric response of PVDF by PEMF, which could provide mechanical strain, is particularly interesting as it could deliver local mechanical stimulation to osteogenic cells using PEMF.\n",

The dielectric, elastic and piezoelectric properties of the resonators have been investigated as functions of temperature (up to 800 degrees C) and vacuum pressure (down to 10(-10) Bar). It was found that all the crystal resonators have excellent stability in the test range of vacuum pressure level; and their fundamental resonant frequencies exhibit temperature dependent characteristics, some of which were linear. It is also found that for CTGS lateral mode, YCOB thickness shear mode and YCOB planar mode resonators, the relative dielectric permittivity epsilon(T)(11)/epsilon(0), epsilon(T)(22)/epsilon(0), epsilon(T)/epsilon(0), are 17.0-18.2 (17.6 +/- 0.6), 13.5-24.4 (19.0 +/- 5.5), 14.0-16.9 (15.4 +/- 1.5); the elastic coefficients S-11(E), S-66(E), S-E are 8.8-93 (9.1 +/- 0.3), 16.3-17.3 (16.8 +/- 0.5), 8.3-9.2 (8.8 +/- 0.5) (pm(2)/N); and the piezoelectric coefficients d(11), d(26), d are 3.7-3.9 (3.8 +/- 0.1), 8.8-10.9 (9.9 +/- 1.0), 3.3-3.9 (3.6 +/- 0.3)(pC/N), respectively. Mechanical quality factor Q was found to be 4500-7000 and 6000-11,000 for CTGS and YCOB, respectively. The excellent property stability of these CTGS and YCOB piezoelectric resonators, especially the thickness shear mode, make them very promising candidates for sensing applications at high-temperature and high-vacuum conditions.

            "Tooth caries is a carbohydrate-modified bacterial infectious disease, and recurrent caries is a frequent reason for restoration failure. The objective of this study was to develop a novel antibacterial composite using tetracalcium phosphate (TTCP) fillers and bis(2-methacryloyloxy-ethyl) dimethyl-ammonium bromide, which is a quaternary ammonium dimethacrylate (QADM). QADM was synthesized using 2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate and 2-bromoethyl methacrylate and incorporated into a resin. The resin was filled with 40% TTCP and 30% glass particles. The following QADM mass fractions in the composite were tested: 0%, 6%, 12%, and 18%. Streptococcus mutans biofilms were formed on the composites and the colony-forming units (CFUs), metabolic activity, and lactic acid production were measured. The TTCP-QADM composite had flexural strength and elastic modulus similar to those of two commercial composites (p > 0.1). Increasing the QADM content in TTCP composite greatly decreased the bacteria growth and biofilm matrix production. There were significantly more dead bacteria with increasing QADM content. TTCP composite containing 18% QADM had biofilm CFU, metabolic activity, and acid production about half of those without QADM. Inversely linear relationships were established between QADM mass fraction and S. mutans biofilm CFU, metabolic activity, and acid production, with correlation coefficients R2 = 0.98. In conclusion, TTCP-QADM composites were developed and the effect of QADM mass fraction on the antibacterial properties of the composite was determined for the first time. The novel TTCP-QADM composites possessing a strong antibacterial capability, together with calcium phosphate ion release and good mechanical properties, are promising for dental restorations to reduce biofilm growth and recurrent caries.

            "Background: Calculus composed of inorganic and organic components with bacteria formed on teeth gets deposited on orthodontic wires. The reason for calculus formation and impact of calcium precipitating bacteria (CPB) on orthodontic wire were studied. A pilot study on electrochemical characterization of CPB on orthodontic wires was done.Methods: CPB were isolated from orthodontic patients and identified by molecular techniques. The electrochemical behavior of two isolates (CPB-1 and CPB-3) on orthodontic wires was studied by employing polarization and impedance techniques. The CPB morphology by scanning electron microscopy and chemical characterization of CPB and tooth pulp stone were studied by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).Results: The two isolates Bacillus megaterium (CPB-1) and Paenibacillus sp. (CPB-3) identified with 16S rRNA sequencing method increased pH of B4 medium from 5.32 to 8.3. The carboxylic acid and phosphate groups identified in FTIR analysis acted as nucleation sites for calcium deposition. The biogenic crystal phases identified in teeth pulp stone by XRD were similar to bacterial isolates cultured in the laboratory. The electrochemical studies with two CPB species revealed that biogenic calcium phosphate species act as cathodic inhibitors on orthodontic wire.Conclusion: The present study concluded that teeth pulp stone formation is due to CPB and high pH determines the mineralization process. Diffusion process and dispersive capacitive behavior indicate that the chloride ions may penetrate through calcium deposits and initiate pitting corrosion on orthodontic wire which may enhance the leaching of toxic elements in saliva.

            "Ink formulation is one of the main challenges with ceramic 3D printing. Here, we present a new, reactive-colloidal hybrid ink for 3D printing by robocasting of BaTiO3-based ceramics. The hybrid ink combines a titanium isopropoxide-based sol-gel base with a colloidal dispersion of powder, here demonstrated with BaTiO3 both as the sol-gel (by reaction of titanium isopropoxide and barium oxide) and colloidal (by addition of BaTiO3 powder) parts. Addition of glycerol was necessary to avoid fast precipitation and poor dispersion of BaTiO3 from the reaction of BaO and Ti-isopropoxide. With a solid loading of 40 vol% BaTiO3, 10 mm tall structures could be printed with minimal deformation from slumping. The BaTiO3 shows good piezo-, ferro- and dielectric properties after sintering, with a piezoelectric charge coefficient (d33 = 159 pC/N) in the range commonly reported for BaTiO3. The hybrid inks developed in this work are therefore suitable for robocasting of BaTiO3-based electroceramics.\n",

In this work, the equation of state of this mineral was calculated by using the quasi-harmonic approximation, also including for the first time the temperature effect. In athermal conditions (0 K), we found that the pressure dependence of the hydroxylapatite unit cell volume is well described by a third-order Birch-Murnaghan formulation, with parameters K-0=115.9(1), K'=4.47(6), and V-0=524.323(27). The inclusion of temperature led to a lower bulk modulus, for example, KT0=109.55 GPa at 300 K. The thermal expansion coefficient between 0 and 1000 K was also reported. The results are in good agreement with the few available experimental data reported in literature and further extend the knowledge of the mechanical and thermal behavior of this important mineral.\n",

            "Piezocrystals, especially the relaxor-based ferroelectric crystals, have been subject to intense investigation and development within the past three decades, motivated by the performance advantages offered by their ultrahigh piezoelectric coefficients and higher electromechanical coupling coefficients than piezoceramics. Structural anisotropy of piezocrystals also provides opportunities for devices to operate in novel vibration modes, such as the d(36) face shear mode, with domain engineering and special crystal cuts. These piezocrystal characteristics contribute to their potential usage in a wide range of low- and high-power ultrasound applications. In such applications, conventional piezoelectric materials are presently subject to varying mechanical stress/pressure, temperature and electric field conditions. However, as observed previously, piezocrystal properties are significantly affected by a single such condition or a combination of conditions. Laboratory characterisation of the piezocrystal properties under these conditions is therefore essential to fully understand these materials and to allow electroacoustic transducer design in realistic scenarios. This will help to establish the extent to which these high performance piezocrystals can replace conventional piezoceramics in demanding applications. However, such characterisation requires specific experimental arrangements, examples of which are reported here, along with relevant results. The measurements include high frequency-resolution impedance spectroscopy with the piezocrystal material under mechanical stress 0-60 MPa, temperature 20-200 degrees C, high electric AC drive and DC bias. A laser Doppler vibrometer and infrared thermal camera are also integrated into the measurement system for vibration mode shape scanning and thermal conditioning with high AC drive. Three generations of piezocrystal have been tested: (I) binary, PMN-PT; (II) ternary, PIN-PMN-PT; and (III) doped ternary, Mn:PIN-PMN-PT. Utilising resonant mode analysis, variations in elastic, dielectric and piezoelectric constants and coupling coefficients have been analysed, and tests with thermal conditioning have been carried out to assess the stability of the piezocrystals under high power conditions.\n",

Tet un-competitively inhibited SR Ca2+Mg2+-ATPase activity, causing the stoichiometric ratio of SR Ca2+/ATP to decrease to 1.43 from 2.0 of control.4 Inhibitory rates on SR Ca2+, Mo2+-ATPasr by Tet were reduced from 60% in the absence of phosphate to 50% in the presence of phosphate and reduced from 92% in I mmol l(-1) ATP to 60% in 5 mmol l(-1) ATP.5 Tet markedly reduced SR intrinsic protein fluorescence, while it slightly decreased the thiol(SH)modified protein fluorescence of SR labelled with N-(3-pyrene)-maleimide.6 Tet slightly increased fluorescence polarization in the middle and deep layers of SR membrane lipids labelled with 7- or 12-(9-anthroyloxy) stearic acid (AS) probes, whereas it did not change that of SR labelled with 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatrine (DPH).7 These results revealed that prevention of SR calcium uptake by Tet was due to inhibition of the SK calcium pump Ca2+, Mg2+-ATPase, changes in spatial conformation of the pumps protein molecules and a decrease in the extent of motion of membrane lipid molecules, thus altering the regulation of [Ca2+](i) and myocardial contractility.\n",

Also, the physical, biological, and nanomechanical properties of the anodized Ti6Al4V alloy consisting TiO2 nanotubes, electrodeposited hydroxyapatite, and the hydroxyapatite/TiO2 nanotubes double layer coating on Ti6Al4V alloy implants are compared. Mean cell viability of the samples being 84.63% for uncoated plate, 91.53% for electrodeposited hydroxyapatite, and 94.98% for hydroxyapatite/TiO2 nanotubes coated sample were in the acceptable range. Merely anodized prototype had the highest biocompatibility of 110% with respect to the control sample. Bonding strength of hydroxyapatite deposit to the substrate increased from 12 +/- 2 MPa to 25.4 +/- 2 MPa using intermediate TiO2 nanotubes layer. Hardness and elastic modulus of the anodized surface were 956 MPa and 64.7 GPa, respectively. The corresponding values for hydroxyapatite deposit were approximately measured 44.3 MPa and 0.66 GPa, respectively, while the average obtained values for hardness (159.3 MPa) and elastic modulus (2.25 GPa) of the hydroxyapatite/TiO2 nanotubes double coating improved more than 30% of the pure hydroxyapatite deposit. Friction coefficient (xi) of the anodized surface was 0.32 +/- 0.02. The calculated friction coefficient enhanced from 0.65 +/- 0.04 for sole hydroxyapatite layer to the 0.46 +/- 0.02 for hydroxyapatite/TiO2 nanotubes due to presence of nanotubular TiO2 intermediate layer.\n",

            "Laser surface modification of Ti-6Al-4V with an existing calcium phosphate coating has been conducted to enhance the surface properties. The electrochemical and mechanical behaviors of calcium phosphate deposited on a Ti-6Al-4V surface and remelted using a Nd:YAG laser at varying laser power densities (25-50 W/mm(2)) have been studied and the results are presented. The electrochemical properties of the modified surfaces in Ringer's physiological solution were evaluated by employing both potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods. The potentiodynamic polarizations showed an increase in the passive current density of Ti-6Al-4V after laser modification at power densities up to 35 W/mm(2), after which it exhibited a decrease. A reduction in the passive current density (by more than an order) was observed with an increase in the laser power density from 25 to 50 W/mm(2). EIS studies at the open circuit potential (OCP) and in the passive region at 1.19 V showed that the polarization resistance increased from 8.274 x 10(3) to 4.38 x 10(5) Omega cm(2) with increasing laser power densities. However, the magnitudes remain lower than that of the untreated Ti-6Al-4V at OCP. The average hardness and modulus of the laser treated Ti-6Al-4V, evaluated by the nanoindentation method, were determined to be 5.4-6.5 GPa (with scatter <+/- 0.976 GPa) and 124-155 GPa (with scatter <+/- 13 GPa) respectively. The corresponding hardness and modulus of untreated Ti-6Al-4V were similar to 4.1 (+/- 0.62) and similar to 148 (+/- 7) GPa respectively. Laser processing at power densities > 35 W/mm(2) enhanced the surface properties (as passive current density is reduced) so that the materials may be suitable for the biomedical applications.\n",

Sophisticated software tools applied to the acquired tomography data were used to characterize the printing quality and the porosity by means of the distance transform, the radial density distribution and the accessibility by virtual spheres. Analyzing the stress-strain curves of the scaffolds, the Young's modulus and the ultimate compressive strength were obtained. To reach mechanical properties comparable to those of jaw bone, the scaffolds were treated with phosphoric acid. Depending on the design, the compressive strength of the bone scaffolds lies between 30 and 60 MPa and their Young's modulus is between 50 and 140 MPa.

Stylets are solid, nail-shaped structures that typically reach lengths of 50-200 .mu.m. Each stylet is composed of a centrally located organic matrix surrounded by an inorganic cortex that contains Ca and P. When viewed at high magnifications, fine granules can be seen throughout the organic matrix, and the cortex appears to be composed of densely packed homogeneous material. Fractured specimens and whole matrices isolated from decalcified stylets reveal a close correspondence between the shape of the organic matrix and that of the surrounding cortex. This similarity in morphology suggests that the organic matrix serves as a template during calcification of the stylet. The fact that abundant material can be seen in the core of incinerated stylets, and in the central region of stylets that had been soaked for several hours in sodium hypochlorite, supports the hypothesis that the organic matrix is also highly calcified. Polarization microscopy of nemertean stylets indicates that they are composed of a crystalline, rather than amorphous, form of calcium phosphate. The probable organization of the calcium phosphate crystals is discussed.\n"

Hydrolysis of calcium phosphates was remarkably by the above additives at room temperature and accelerated above 80ﾟC.Thermal decomposition products of hydroxyapatite, alpha-Ca_3(PO_4)_2, beta-Ca_3(PO_4)_2, and amorphous calcium phosphate were used as calcium phosphate cements. The calcium phosphate hardened bodies obtained were found to be about 1.7 in bulk density and 11-12 MPa in bending strength, which was doubled compared with that obtained on no addition of polymers.(2) We have discovered the acceleration and deceleration of bone-like crystal growth in simulated body fluid solution on polarized ceramics and coatings of hydroxyapatite, depending on the electric polarization conditions. The crystal growth was dependent upon the dc field strength, temperature, and time for polarization. The accelerated crystal growth was observed on negatively charged surfaces, whereas no crystal growth ever took place on the positively charged surface.

This review explores the intricate relationship between biotribology, material selection, and device efficacy, such as advancements in high-performance polymers like PEEK (polyetheretherketone), noting that they exhibit wear rates reduced by up to 48% compared to traditional materials, with coefficients of friction as low as 0.01 under dry conditions. Emphasis is placed on specific compositions and resultant microstructures that lead to enhanced tribological performance and biocompatibility. For example, the elastic modulus and nano-hardness of Bis-GMA/TEGDMA composites increased from 9.2 GPa and 420 MPa for 20% micro-sized hydroxyapatite to 16.8 GPa and 608 MPa for 20% micro-sized tricalcium phosphate reinforcement, indicating that the lower values in hydroxyapatite-containing composites can be attributed to its larger particle size compared to tricalcium phosphate. In cardiovascular devices, surface modifications, such as TiO2/TiN coatings, have shown to extend wear resistance, with coated artificial heart valves enduring over 38 million cycles without wear, while non-coated valves exhibited significant abrasion after 18 million cycles. Additionally, innovative designs in artificial joints and dental implants focus on mitigating fretting wear and improving stability through material optimization and surface treatments. This review highlights the importance of biotribological principles in the design of modern medical devices, vital in future advancements and improved patient outcomes.\n",

Despite its rich bioactive compound content, AWB is underutilized. To address these issues, we propose incorporating waste-derived calcium phosphate phases from AWB into an alumina toughened zirconia (ATZ) composite, forming a Hydroxyapatite/Tricalcium Phosphate/Whitlockite-ATZ biocomposite. The high-temperature treatment during ATZ consolidation promotes Hydroxyapatite (HAp) formation and decomposition of HAp to Tricalcium phosphate (TCP) phases. Trace amounts of magnesium in AWB aid in Whitlockite (Wk) formation. This triphasic material exhibits excellent biocompatibility and osteoconduction, suitable for bone regeneration. ATZ ensures mechanical stability and counters degradation of calcium phosphate phases. Although AWB incorporation reduces mechanical properties, the resulting ATZ-AWB biocomposite meets acceptable biomaterial standards. The present ATZ-AWB biocomposite possess bulk density, apparent porosity, hardness, and bending strength in the range of 3.7-5.2 g/cm3, 3.6-17%, 2-9 GPa and 620-1000 MPa respectively. AWB incorporation enhances bioactivity, as demonstrated by increased apatite layer formation in simulated body fluid (SBF). By fostering bioactivity, this approach not only tackles biocircularity but also offers economically accessible biomaterials, thereby advancing environmental sustainability and socioeconomic progress.\n",

            "Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement is the most widely used material in surgery to fix joint replacements in the bone. In this study, we propose a new approach to generate bioactive PMMA surfaces directly at the site of implantation by adding the amphiphilic molecule phosphorylated 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA-P) to commercial PMMA bone cement, both with or without addition of 15% soluble calcium and carbonate salts. The setting behavior as well as the mechanical properties, the bonding quality at the metal/cement interface, mineral deposition, and cellular response for different cement modifications were investigated in vitro. The addition of HEMA-P resulted in entirely positive effects with respect to proliferation and differentiation of osteoblast-like cells (SaOs-2) and a very tight contact at the metal/cement interface. No detrimental changes of other properties were detected. The additional incorporation of salts provoked an increased deposition of calcium phosphate minerals but no further improvement in SaOs-2 cell differentiation. A significant decrease in polarization resistance for cements with high salt content (5%) was attributed to debonding between metal and cement. The results suggest an improved clinical performance of PMMA/HEMA-P composites, which might be further enhanced by small amounts of the soluble salts. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The sludges studied were an anaerobically-digested and heat-treated sludge (Paris-Acheres), an activated sludge (Briare) and an anaerobically-digested sludge (Nancy). NMR observations were conducted using both single-pulse and cross-polarization sequences in order to distinguish between P-31 nuclei far from H-1 nuclei, and P-31 located within a fraction of a nanometre of H-1. This approach showed that a complex mixture of P species was present in these sludges. A mixture of hydrogenated octocalcium phosphates and apatites was observed in the three samples. Monetite was present in the anaerobically-digested sludge and brushite in the activated sludge. Dehydrogenated condensed calcium phosphates (compounds with a Ca:P ratio higher than 1.0 such as fluorapatite or tricalcium phosphate) and dehydrogenated pyrophosphates were also probably present in the anaerobically-digested sludge. A poorly-ordered wavellite was observed in the three sludges after the HCl extraction. However, results were inconclusive as to whether this mineral was present in the three sludges, or had been precipitated during the sequential extraction.\n",

            "This study investigates the use of hydroxyapatite (HAp) doped with hexavalent tungsten to improve its interaction with bone cells and to influence the polarizing capacity of HAp. Increases in dopant concentration increased the beta-TCP phases and decreased the HAp phases in sintered samples. Results of thermally stimulated depolarization current measurements suggested that doped HAp had stored fewer charge compared with pure HAp. However, the decrease in stored charge was related to fraction of HAp or beta-TCP phases present in sintered samples. Activation energy of dipole relaxation and stored charge was used to examine the mechanism of polarization. The charge stored in doped samples due to polarization was attributed to the migration of H+ ions in HAp phases and O2- or Ca2+ ions in beta-TCP phases. Hindrance of ion migration due to the presence of different phases appeared to lower charge storage ability in doped samples. In vitro study revealed an increase in bioactivity of doped HAp when compared with pure HAp. Polarization further improved the bioactivity of doped HAp. Results of our study provide evidence for the use of higher valent cations to improve biological performance of HAp ceramics. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The passive film on Ti behaved as an n-type semiconductor containing two layers: an inner oxide layer with a large Eg and an outer hydroxide layer with a small Eg. In Hanks, Eg was 3.3-3.4 eV in the inner oxide layer and 2.9 eV in the outer hydroxide layer. In saline, Eg was 3.3 eV in the inner layer and 2.7 eV in the outer layer. Calcium phosphate and hydroxyl groups influenced the band structure of the passive film. The Eg of the outermost surface was smaller than that of TiO2 ceramics, which is probably one of the principles of the excellent biocompatibility of Ti among metals. Copyright: CC BY 4.0\n"

            "In this study we compare three droplet microreactors for the synthesis of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CONs) and calcium phosphate crystals (CaPs) and discuss their suitability for long-term, continuous operation. The synthesis conditions were controlled by manipulating the flow rate ratio of the continuous phase to the dispersed (Qc/Qd), which is a crucial factor influencing droplet formation rate (DF) and droplet size. After identifying appropriate operating conditions (droplet size between 400 and 500 mu m), synthesis experiments were conducted to test the continuous operation of the microreactors. Among the three designs, one flow focusing device with a buffer stream, demonstrated superior resilience to particle fouling, and seemed to be appropriate for long-term, continuous particle synthesis. Particles synthesized using microfluidics were consistently smaller and exhibited less crystallinity than those produced during conventional batch synthesis due to the short residence time in the microreactor.\n",

            "Degradable bone cement has superior osteoconductivity and plasticity and is commonly used to treat defects greater than the critical-size. Magnesium gallate metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) (Mg-MOF), with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, are doped into a composite cement composed of calcium sulfate, calcium citrate, and dicalcium hydrogen phosphate anhydrous (CS/CC/DCPA). The doping of the Mg-MOF slightly influences the microstructure and curing properties of the composite cement, with the mechanical strength of the cement displaying a significant increase from 27 to 32 MPa. Antibacterial tests reveal that the Mg-MOF bone cement has excellent antibacterial characteristics and can effectively inhibit bacterial growth in 4 h (Staphyloccocus aureus survival rate <10%). Herein, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophage models are used to investigate the anti-inflammatory characteristics of composite cement. The Mg-MOF bone cement can regulate the inflammatory factors and polarization of macrophages (M1 and M2). In addition, the composite cement promotes cell proliferation and osteo-differentiation of mBMSCs, and the activity of alkaline phosphatase and calcium nodules are increased. The bone related transcription factor and specific proteins, such as runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), bone morphogenetic protein 2, osteocalcin (OCN), osteopontin (OPN), and collagen type 1 (COL1), were highly expressed by the Mg-MOF bone cements. Therefore, Mg-MOF doped CS/CC/DCPA bone cement is multifunctional for bone repair, which will promote bone formation and avoid the infection of wounds, and it is suitable for use with non-load-bearing bone defects.\n",

            "Porous composites are important in engineering fields for their lightweight, thermal insulation, and mechanical properties. However, increased porosity commonly decreases the robustness, making a trade-off between mechanics and weight. Optimizing the strength of solid structure is a promising way to co-enhance the robustness and lightweight properties. Here, acrylamide and calcium phosphate ionic oligomers are copolymerized, revealing a pre-interaction of these precursors induced oriented crystallization of inorganic nanostructures during the linear polymerization of acrylamide, leading to the spontaneous formation of a bone-like nanostructure. The resulting solid phase shows enhanced mechanics, surpassing most biological materials. The bone-like nanostructure remains intact despite the introduction of porous structures at higher levels, resulting in a porous composite (P-APC) with high strength (yield strength of 10.5 MPa) and lightweight properties (density below 0.22 g cm-3). Notably, the density-strength property surpasses most reported porous materials. Additionally, P-APC shows ultralow thermal conductivity (45 mW m-1 k-1) due to its porous structure, making its strength and thermal insulation superior to many reported materials. This work provides a robust, lightweight, and thermal insulating composite for practical application. It emphasizes the advantage of prefunctionalization of ionic oligomers for organic-inorganic copolymerization in creating oriented nanostructure with toughened mechanics, offering an alternative strategy to produce robust lightweight materials.Porous materials featuring high strength are of great importance. This work introduces a strategy for creating ordered biomimetic nanostructures while simultaneously generating a porous network structure at higher hierarchy levels. It is achieved by prefunctionalization of calcium phosphate oligomers by organic molecules, which builds a relationship between linear organic polymerization and ordered inorganic crystallization during organic-inorganic copolymerization reactions. The ordered structure efficiently enhances the mechanical property of porous composite at low density. image\n",

The composite was damaged after autoclaving for 24 h at 300 degrees C and then exposed to the same conditions for 5 more days for the self-healing and re-adhering processes. The ability of the blend to self-heal and re-adhere to CS was evaluated 1) by measurements of the recovery of compressive and bond strengths and Young's modulus; 2) by performing the 3-dimensional micro-image analysis of sealed cracks; 3) by phase identification in composite matrix and in the cracks after the healing; 4) by measurements of CS corrosion impediment by the re-adhered composite after 300 degrees C-5-day restoration period. After the healing, the two factors, sealing effect of cracks by reaction products and change in phase composition of cement matrix, essentially governed the recovery of the original mechanical strength. For the former, analcime phase derived from pozzolanic FAF autogenous healing aid played the major role in sealing the cracks, while the well-formed hydroxyapatite phase contributed to the latter factor. The lap-shear bond with the strength of 1.11 MPa at CS plate/composite adhesive/CS plate joint failed cohesively, showing higher bond strength than strength of the composite matrix. The rebonded composite-CS plates developed a 0.37 MPa bond strength after the 5-day restoration period. The results of electrochemical polarization corrosion tests revealed that the re-adhered composite covering CS plate significantly inhibited the brine-caused corrosion of CS, leading to 0.011 mm/year corrosion rate, corresponding to 50% reduction compared with that of before re-adhering. There were two factors governing such corrosion mitigation: enhanced adhesive contact of composite with CS and increased coverage by the re-adhering composite.\n",

            "Most enzymes present a catalytic mechanism where one or more proton transfer events occur coupled tightly together with the enzymatic chemical reaction. We show here that inactivating mutations decouple this proton transfer step from the phosphate cleavage reaction in dUTPase. Homotrimeric dUTPase enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of dUTP to dUMP and pyrophosphate, using largely similar structural and functional groups as most AAA+ enzymes. dUTPases typically use a single Mg2+ ion as a cofactor in the active site that is formed by direct protein protein contacts including all three protomers. Here we focus on the C-terminal arm structural motif, which has sequence and functional similarities to P-loop motifs and is required for catalysis. In this work, we have studied the functional roles of the C-terminal arm in ligand binding and catalysis by using QM/MM (quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics) calculations in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis experiments. We also present a new method to assess the metal ion coordination symmetry during the catalytic reaction. Using this new implementation, we identified that the coordination symmetry follows a consistent pattern in the three systems studied, reaching the most symmetrical state near the transition states. We found that the phosphate cleavage proceeds with a concerted bimolecular (A(N)D(N)) mechanism with a loose dissociative transition state and that it is coupled with a proton transfer step involving a unanimously conserved Asp residue. We show that the main mechanistic effect of the lack of the C-terminal ann is to decouple the phosphate cleavage from the subsequent proton transfer step, resulting in a high-barrier altered reaction pathway.\n"

            "The biomaterial poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) is commonly used for bone fixation devices and dental surgeries; however its natural osseointegrating ability is generally poor, which can lead to dislocation and partial fractures. Recently, calcium phosphate bioceramics have been incorporated into PLLA in order to redress this issue and improve the osseointegrating ability of the material. This study incorporated calcium phosphate microbeads in PLLA at various concentrations and measured their effect on the critical stress intensity factor, K-IC and critical energy release rate at crack initiation, G(in), as well as the unusual fracture mechanic they induced. The inclusion of microbeads into the polymer matrix reduced the materials' fracture toughness, from a K-IC of 34 +/- 7 Pa m(-1/2) for blank PLLA, to 18 +/- 1 Pa m(-1/2) for the strongest bead containing group; and from a G(in) of 1030 +/- 150 J m(-2) for blank PLLA to 200 +/- 18 J m(-2) for the same microbead containing group. Importantly however, the microbead containing groups fractured by a different mechanism, which was identified by observing fracture surface morphologies, electron probe microanalysis and finite element analysis. It was seen that polymer intruded into the porous microbeads, and resulted in regions of increased stiffness in the polymer matrix around each bead. This prevented void formation at the polymer/microbead interface, but it allowed the strain energy density to increase rapidly under load in microbead containing groups. This energy concentration in turn caused fractures to occur sooner, and resulted in the brittle fracture surfaces seen around microbeads. The identification of this fracture mechanism is important to understand, as it suggests a way to greatly improve the fracture toughness of the material, reducing the difference in stiffness of the two components. This fracture mechanism may also be useful in explaining other observed fracture events containing two materials of greatly varying stiffness.\n"

            "Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a double-edged sword. Pathological HO presents as an undesired clinical complication, whereas controlled heterotopic bone formation by synthetic osteoinductive materials shows promising therapeutic potentials for bone regeneration. However, the mechanism of material-induced heterotopic bone formation remains largely unknown. Early acquired HO being usually accompanied by severe tissue hypoxia prompts the hypothesis that hypoxia caused by the implantation coordinates serial cellular events and ultimately induces heterotopic bone formation in osteoinductive materials. The data presented herein shows a link between hypoxia, macrophage polarization to M2, osteoclastogenesis, and material-induced bone formation. Hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha), a crucial mediator of cellular responses to hypoxia, is highly expressed in an osteoinductive calcium phosphate ceramic (CaP) during the early phase of implantation, while pharmacological inhibition of HIF-1 alpha significantly inhibits M2 macrophage, subsequent osteoclast, and material-induced bone formation. Similarly, in vitro, hypoxia enhances M2 macrophage and osteoclast formation. Osteoclast-conditioned medium enhances osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, such enhancement disappears with the presence of HIF-1 alpha inhibitor. Furthermore, metabolomics analysis reveals that hypoxia enhances osteoclastogenesis via the axis of M2/lipid-loaded macrophages. The current findings shed new light on the mechanism of HO and favor the design of more potent osteoinductive materials for bone regeneration.\n",

Biomedical research has emphasized the role of sarcomeric protein function for the normal performance and energy efficiency of the heart, suggesting that directly targeting the contractile myofilaments themselves using small molecule effectors has therapeutic potential and will likely result in greater drug efficacy and selectivity. In this study, we developed a robust and highly reproducible fluorescence polarization-based high throughput screening (HTS) assay that directly targets the calcium-dependent interaction between cardiac troponin C (cTnC) and the switch region of cardiac troponin I (cTnI(SP)), with the aim of identifying small molecule effectors of the cardiac thin filament activation pathway. We screened a commercially available small molecule library and identified several hit compounds with both inhibitory and activating effects. We used a range of biophysical and biochemical methods to characterize hit compounds and identified fingolimod, a sphingosin-1-phosphate receptor modulator, as a new troponin-based small molecule effector. Fingolimod decreased the ATPase activity and calcium sensitivity of demembranated cardiac muscle fibers in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that the compound acts as a calcium desensitizer. We investigated fingolimod's mechanism of action using a combination of computational studies, biophysical methods, and synthetic chemistry, showing that fingolimod bound to cTnC repels cTnI(SP) via mainly electrostatic repulsion of its positively charged tail. These results suggest that fingolimod is a potential new lead compound/scaffold for the development of troponin-directed heart failure therapeutics.\n",

The present work describes an effort to understand, control, and tune the formation of protein-inorganic calcium- phosphate supraparticles that are produced at an oscillating air-water interface created by endover-end rotation of the synthesis solution. Supraparticles were synthesized under an array of different conditions that varied reagent concentration, the presence of additives, tube size, and rotational speed. Paired with a fluid mechanics model of the end-over-end rotation and dimensional analysis, the sensitivity of the synthesis to physicochemical and mechanical parameters was determined. Surface tension and bubble formation were found to be important criteria for changing the size distribution of supraparticles. Thresholds for the values of the Froude, Iribarren, and rotational Reynolds numbers were identified for narrowing particle size distribution. These results both guide the specific protein-inorganic supraparticle synthesis described here and inform future manipulation and scale-up of other complex interfacial colloidal assemblies.\n",

Deformable and tough biomaterials are desirable for self-compressible hemostasis, although their preparation is challenging. Here, a critical-size calcium phosphate (C-CaP) with polymer-like high deformability and mineral-like high bending strength is prepared, which is hybridized with silk fibroin (SF) to fabricate a hemostatic sponge (SF-C). C-CaP endows SF-C with an ultrahigh elastic modulus (36.0 kPa) among analogous materials, leading to an ultrafast water absorption rate (1.2 g cm-3 s-1) and space-filling rate (200.0%/s). The deformability of the SF-C sponge further enables self-adaptability to defects with micrometre-scale precision. Consequently, SF-C achieves rapid hemostasis in both damaged soft tissues and hard tissues in rats, resulting in less blood loss and a shorter hemostatic time than those of clinical materials. This study provides a promising hemostatic material for the treatment of hemorrhages in defective tissues and expands the current knowledge by revealing the critical-sized ionic structure and unique mechanics of C-CaP.In this study, silk fibroin (SF) with critical-sized calcium phosphate crystal chains (C-CaP) are hybridized, which exhibit polymer-like high deformability and mineral-like high bending strength, to fabricate a hemostatic sponge (SF-C).

Characterization of the films obtained was performed by energy dispersive spectroscopy, micro-Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, nanoindentation and tribological testing. Better control of the chemical composition and phases was found for coatings deposited at 200 degrees C, with a Ca/P ratio of 1.66 recorded for the system obtained at 4 cm distance from the target. Moreover, the vibration of the OH group of HA was preferentially observed in coatings deposited at this temperature. Similarly, higher crystallinity was evidenced in comparison to the coatings obtained at room temperature. Similar behaviors were found for the mechanical properties, which for each system, reduced with increased distance, and improved with increased temperature. Again, the highest values were obtained for the coating deposited at 4 cm and 200 degrees C, which presented hardness of 7 +/- 0.4 GPa, elastic modulus of 134 +/- 7 GPa, and critical load of 169 +/- 5 mN.

The elasticity of pectin hydrogels, measured as Young's modulus, ranged from 6 to 100 kPa. The mechanical properties of the pectin hydrogels were shown to correspond to those of soft tissues. The characterization of surface roughness in terms of the roughness profile (Ra) and the root-mean-square deviation of the roughness profile (Rq) indicated an increased roughness profile for hydrogels depending on their pectin concentration. The adhesion of AU2% and AU4% hydrogels to the serosa abdominal wall, liver, and colon was higher than that of the AU1% hydrogel. The adhesion of macrophages and the non-specific adsorption of blood plasma proteins were found to increase as the pectin concentration in the hydrogels increased.

            "Kinetics of NMR cross-polarization (CP) from protons to phosphorus-31 nuclei was studied in the following samples: mineral of whole human bone, apatite prepared from bone, natural brushite, synthetic hydroxyapatite (hydrated and calcined), and synthetic carbonatoapatite of type B with 9 wt% Of CO32- In order to avoid an effect of magic angle spinning on CP and relaxation, the experiments were carried out on static samples. Parameters of the CP kinetics were discussed for trabecular and cortical bone tissue from adult subjects in comparison to the synthetic mineral standards. It was found that carbonatoapatite shows similar CP behavior to the bone mineral. Both materials undergo two-component CP kinetics. The fast-relaxing classical component is from the surface of apatite crystals and the slow-relaxing nonclassical component comes from the crystal interior. The components have been unambiguously assigned using inverse CP from phosphorus-31 to protons. The study provides information on a structured water layer, which covers crystal surface of carbonato- and bone apatite. The layer encompasses ca 40% of apatite phosphorus and its thickness is more than ca 2 nm. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n",

            "Understanding the phenomena that govern complex interfacial and directed assemblies is essential for both control and scale-up of particle syntheses. The present work describes an effort to understand, control, and tune the formation of protein-inorganic calcium-phosphate supraparticles that are produced at an oscillating air-water interface created by end-over-end rotation of the synthesis solution. Supraparticles were synthesized under an array of different conditions that varied reagent concentration, the presence of additives, tube size, and rotational speed. Paired with a fluid mechanics model of the end-over-end rotation and dimensional analysis, the sensitivity of the synthesis to physicochemical and mechanical parameters was determined. Surface tension and bubble formation were found to be important criteria for changing the size distribution of supraparticles. Thresholds for the values of the Froude, Iribarren, and rotational Reynolds numbers were identified for narrowing particle size distribution. These results both guide the specific protein-inorganic supraparticle synthesis described here and inform future manipulation and scale-up of other complex interfacial colloidal assemblies.\n"

            "Calcium phosphate cement (CPC) is a widely used bone substitute in the clinic; however, the low strength of CPC limits its utilization. In this study, we investigated mechanical influences of chitosan fiber combined with gelatin on CPC, and examined the biocompatibility of the new composite with rat bone marrow stromal cells. Compared to the fiber impregnated in phosphate buffered saline (80.5 MPa), our study showed that tensile strength of chitosan fiber increased 106 and 114% with the impregnation of gelatin at the mass fraction 5 and 10%, although this increase was not statistically significant. It was demonstrated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy that the characteristic absorption bands of chitosan were changed with the addition of gelatin. The optimal flexural strength enhancement was obtained when CPC was reinforced with fiber at volume fraction of 30% and gelatin at mass fraction of 5% (maximum: 12.31 MPa). The fiber morphology was more compact when the chitosan fibers impregnated with gelatin at mass fraction of 5 or 10% than chitosan alone. The fracture analysis showed that the new CPC-chitosan fiber-gelatin composite presented many remnants of CPC adhered to fibers. Short minimum essential medium extract test showed no cell growth inhibition after the addition of the new composite. Rat bone marrow stromal cells retain the ability to spread and grow on the composite. Our studies demonstrated that the flexural strength is greatly increased by using CPC incorporated with proper ratio of CF and gelatin. More over, the new composite demonstrated biocompatibility in vitro. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",

The mechanical properties of the glasses were as follows: bending strength similar to 100 MPa, Young's modulus 94-83 GPa, Vickers microhardness 7.1-4.1 GPa and toughness 0.8 MPa m(1/2). The bioactive properties were discussed in terms of their structure deduced by MAS-NMR spectroscopy and the field strength of the network modifiers (Mg2+ and Ca2+).

            "Struvite (MgNH4PO4 center dot 6H(2)O) is a mineral first identified in 1845. It is tested for several reasons: (1) it is a problem in liquid wastewater treatment plants; (2) on the other hand, it is recovered from this wastewater because of phosphorus, magnesium, and nitrogen; (3) it is the main component of infectious urinary stones. In this paper, we present the first experimental evidences of the ferroelectric nature of struvite at room temperature. Struvite shows a hysteresis loop and spontaneous electric polarization that can be reversed by an application of an external electric field. The measured value of residual polarization of struvite is equal to 0.95 mu C/cm(2). We also report observations of the ferroelectric domains in struvite using birefringence imaging technique. The non-centrosymmetry of the crystal lattice is confirmed with the use of the Kurtz-Perry powder test. The second harmonic generation response for struvite in relation to that of potassium dihydrogen phosphate is 0.36. We suggest that ferroelectric properties for struvite, in particular, spontaneous polarization, can have a significant impact on the behavior of struvite in aqueous solutions, such as liquid wastewater or urine.\n",

            "Pathological calcification of the cardiovascular system is one of the major causes of high mortality and morbidity in dialysis patients. The inhibition of ectopic calcification relies (I) on the formation of calciprotein particles (CPPs), nanospherical complexes of calcium phosphate mineral, fetuin-A and other acidic serum proteins, and (II) on the stabilization of calcium phosphate prenucleation clusters by fetuin-A monomers. In supersaturated serum, mineral ion aggregation leads to a change in the electrical impedance. In this work, we present a method based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to establish an impedance trace of mineral ion clustering in vitro. In the presence of 20 mu M of serum protein fetuin-A, a prototypic calcification inhibitor, we measured a change in impedance (Delta(R)) of 195.52 +/- 27.78% Omega compared to 430.41 +/- 11.36% Omega in inhibitor-free samples. We also identified a CPP-formation dependency on the actual content of ions and protein in the samples under investigation. Two-step ripening of CPP was also observed. The presented method may form the basis of a simple label-free bedside or online test to be used in routine clinical practice for estimating the calcification risk in serum. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The flux-limiting factors of the feed appeared to be osmotic pressure and fouling agents. Protein in Gouda whey at pH 6.6 did not give rise to fouling, but after desalting or decrease of pH to 4.6, fouling by whey protein occurred. If Gouda whey was concentrated at 30.degree. C over a concentration ratio of 1.6:1, calcium-phosphate precipitation caused strong fouling of the membrane. This fouling can be prevented by removing calcium from the whey or by acidifying to a pH of about 6.0. During reverse osmosis of skim milk, casein is the principal fouling material. To understand better the influence of the process conditions on the permeate flux, the effect of concentration polarization and fouling was calculated for various conditions. It appeared possible to achieve a reasonably low concentration polarization and fouling by applying, in a tubular system, flow velocities of 2 m/s for whey and of 2.5 m/s for skim milk. For skim milk an optimum process pressure was about 3.5 MPa [Pascal].\n",

However, the only hindrance in their successful use as biodegradable orthopedic implants is their high corrosion rates in physiological environment. Thus, in present study, we developed the single step hydrothermal process to deposit bioactive coatings that may lower the corrosion rate. Highly crystalline, cytocompatible, bioresorbable and high strength monetite (CaHPO4) coating successfully produced on Ca-containing Mg-alloy via hydrothermal process. Deposition parameters have significant influence on coatings morphology and degree of crystallinity. XRD pattern indicates sharp, intense and well-defined peaks of monetite along with minor peaks of brucite and spinel phases. SEM study reveals that compact and defects free coatings were deposited at 100 degrees C. FTIR analysis showed all characteristic peaks that confirms the presence of monetite. Corrosion behavior of coated and uncoated specimen were analyzed using potentiodynamic polarization scan in simulated body fluid (SBF) at 37 degrees C. Calcium phosphate (CaP) coating significantly improve the degradation rate of Mg-alloy. Corrosion rate was 80% lower in CaP coated Mg-alloy specimens than bare Mg-alloy. Adhesion strength of coatings was determined using lap shear test demonstrating a cohesive failure at 21.89 MPa stress. Furthermore, cytotoxicity of coated and uncoated alloy was assessed by using Alamar Blue (AB) assay on NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cell line for 9 days indicate no significant difference in proliferation of cells for CaP coated Mg-alloy and positive control. These results suggest that hydrothermal method reported here can potentially be used to deposit compact, highly crystalline, bioresorbable, cytocompatible and protective coatings with high adhesion strength on intricate geometries for degradable implant applications.\n",

            "We herein propose a novel low-temperature fabrication process of calcium deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA) 3D scaffolds for bone tissue regeneration through a combination of material extrusion type 3D printing process and bone cement chemistry. The CDHA scaffolds with high porosity of 70% showed excellent mechanical property of 25 MPa (compressive strength), without any sintering process after 3D printing. By using this method, the final structures do not show size shrinkage, which must be considered in conventional ceramic sintering processes. We could therefore achieve both size- and 3D architecture-controlled porous CDHA scaffolds with high accuracy. In addition, the resulting ceramic cement scaffolds were not brittle and could be machined without chipping or fracturing the scaffold. The complete process takes place at physiological conditions (37 degrees C, pH=7), and heat sensitive drugs and biomolecules could be directly loaded onto the raw powder and achieve homogeneous distribution throughout the CDHA scaffold. In this study, we discuss various key factors to complete this low temperature 3D printing fabrication of calcium phosphate, such as the pre-treatment conditions of particles, liquid-to-powder ratio, relationships between strut sizes, infill of structures, setting temperatures and the properties of 3D printed scaffolds. The low-temperature fabrication process of calcium phosphate scaffolds developed in this study has excellent potential for use in bone tissue engineering.\n",

Both the site-group and Davydov (factor-group) splittings of the vibrations of the phosphate group decrease with compression. The shift in site group splitting is consistent with a general increase in phosphate group site symmetry under compression. The anomalous decrease in Davydov splitting can be associated with the decreased distortion of the environment surrounding the phosphorus tetrahedron under compression, and indicates the importance of non-dipole effects in generating the Davydov splitting in apatite. Our results indicate that the change with pressure of the Davydov splitting is not a consequence of simple dipole-dipole interactions, but is rather governed by complex changes in crystal site environments under compression.

            "ObjectiveThe proposed study aimed to fabricate and evaluate the physical, mechanical, thermal, thermo-mechanical, and wear analysis of tri-calcium phosphate and silica filled dental resin composite materials.Materials and MethodsFive dental composite series (TSi0, TSi1, TSi2, TSi3, and TSi4) were developed using organic and inorganic materials. Tricalcium phosphate (TCp) and silicon dioxide (SiO2) were used as filler particles. The amount of TCp varied from 0 to 4 wt.% while SiO2 was constant as 20 wt.%. In this work, physical (void content, water sorption, water solubility, and polymerization shrinkage), mechanical (compressive strength and Vickers hardness), thermal, thermo-mechanical, and wear analysis were investigated.ResultsThe maximum water sorption and solubility were found in TSi4 designated dental composite. The depth of cure decreased with filler loading, with TSi0 achieving the maximum depth of cure. TSi4 displayed a 55.3% higher compressive strength than TSi1 and 8.6% less polymerization shrinkage than TSi0. The filler loading directly influenced the hardness. Fourier-transform infrared spectra showed shifts in peak wave numbers for nano silica and tricalcium phosphate fillers. TSi4 demonstrated the highest storage modulus at 426.01 MPa. In terms of thermal stability, TSi4 outperformed TSi3, TSi2, TSi1, and TSi0 within the temperature span of 25-300 & DEG;C, as determined by thermogravimetric analysis. Moreover, specific wear was evaluated through a pin-on-disc wear test rig and using Taguchi L25 orthogonal array to design the experiment with four factors: normal load, filler loading, RPM, and time. The hybrid dental resin composite substantially affected mechanical, thermal, and viscoelastic characteristics. Grey relational analysis (GRA) approach was used to determine the ranking of dental composites. According GRA method, TSi4 designated dental composite obtained first rank among the dental composites.SignificanceIn conclusion, this research offers valuable insights into optimizing dental composite formulations to enhance the performance of dental restorative materials.\n",

The sintered Mg65Zn30Ca5 samples were in an amorphous state when the spark plasma sintering was performed at a temperature of 383 K under a pressure of 600 MPa. The data of polarization curves presented that the sintered Mg65Zn30Ca5 bulk amorphous alloys exhibited higher corrosion resistance than pure Mg and AZ31B alloy owing to high content of Zn and homogeneous structure. A calcium phosphate compound layer was formed on the sintered Mg65Zn30Ca5 bulk amorphous sample after immersion in Hanks' solution, which is effective in improving corrosion resistance and bioactivity. The sintered MgZnCa bulk amorphous alloys with large dimensions broaden the potential application of bulk amorphous alloys in the biomedical fields.\n",

Therefore, a novel bone cement based on magnesium-doped bioactive glass was developed in this study. The moderate release of magnesium ions improved the mechanical properties by controlling the crystal size of hydroxyapatite. Through detailed discussion of element content and heat treatment temperature, it was found that 2Mg-BG-800 was suitable for the construction of bone cement. 2Mg-BG-BC exhibited favorable initial (15 min) and final (30 min) setting time, compressive strength (29.45 MPa), compressive modulus (1851.49 MPa), injectability, and shape-adaptability. Furthermore, Mg-BG-BC demonstrated the ability to enhance the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, and induce macrophage polarization towards the M2 phenotype, suggesting its potential for osteoporotic fracture regeneration.\n",

The reduced modulus, hardness of the surfaces, and elastic modulus caused by the process along the depth of the indentation on the surfaces are evaluated by the nano-indentation method on the fused silica. The obtained results indicate that applying different indenters such as Berkovich and Cube-Corner reduces the amount and size of surface microcracks. The load-displacement of various indenters such as Berkovich and Cube-Corner with similar load at about 50 mN for the Berkovich shows a 400 nm displacement and a 1600 nm for the Cube-Corner indenter. In this study, the MD was used to describe the mechanical behavior of fused silica structures with atomic nanostructure as simulated at T-0 = 300 K and P-0 = 1 bar as the initial condition. The mechanical constants such as hardness (with Berkovich tip), elastic modulus (with Berkovich tip), and fracture toughness (with Cube Corner tip) of fused silica nanostructure can be calculated from this MD simulation in which the hardness of the atomic matrix is obtained at 8.84 GPa.\n",

The anticorrosive properties of seven phosphate-based pigments, a calcium-exchange silica and a ferrite were assessed by electrochemical techniques and formulating solvent-borne paints with epoxy and alkyd resins. Paints contained 30% by volume of anticorrosive pigment, with respect to the total pigment content.The anticorrosive performance of paints was evaluated by accelerated tests (salt spray chamber) and electrochemical essays (corrosion potential and ionic resistance). Outdoor exposure tests were carried out in an urban-industrial environment during 8 years.The anticorrosive performance of the tested paints showed that there is not a clear relationship between the laboratory tests and the outdoors exposition and that none of them, by themselves can predict the behaviour of the paint under service. However, electrochemical essays with pigments may give an orientation about pigment performance in anticorrosive paints. As a general rule, if the pigment reduces notably steel corrosion rate and generates a rather high apparent polarization resistance a good anticorrosive performance may be expected.

            "The development of temporary biodegradable orthopedic implants has been a key focus in recent years to reduce healthcare costs, minimize the need for multiple surgical interventions, and improve patient satisfaction. In this study, biodegradable magnesium-tin (Mg-Sn) composites reinforced with biphasic calcium phosphate nanoparticles (nBCP) were synthesized and evaluated for advanced orthopedic implant applications. Initially, nBCP was synthesized from bovine tibia bone using a thermal process. Composite samples, including Mg-5wt%Sn, Mg-5wt%Sn-1.25wt%nBCP, and Mg-5wt%Sn-2.5wt%nBCP, were fabricated using the stir casting method, and some underwent homogenization heat treatment at 450 degrees C for 24 h, followed by hot rolling at 445 +/- 10 degrees C. The microstructure, mechanical properties, corrosion resistance, and biocompatibility of these composites were comprehensively analyzed. Optical microscopy (OM) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) revealed significant grain refinement in the Mg-5Sn base alloy and an increase in grain boundaries after hot rolling and the addition of nBCP. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed the formation of a secondary Mg2Sn phase in the composites. Tensile tests showed that the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and yield strength of the rolled samples were approximately 1.7 times higher than those of the as-cast samples, although the elongation percentage was reduced by half. The highest UTS value, 138 MPa, was observed in the rolled Mg-5wt%Sn-2.5wt%nBCP sample. Potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed a reduction in corrosion resistance after hot rolling, attributed to increased dislocation density and internal strain energy; however, the rolled composite containing 2.5wt%nBCP exhibited superior corrosion resistance compared to other rolled samples. Cell toxicity assays (MTT) using MG-63 cells demonstrated enhanced biocompatibility in nBCP-containing samples over a 7-day period, with the rolled Mg-5wt%Sn-2.5wt%nBCP composite showing the highest cell survival rate. Overall, the findings suggest that the rolled Mg-5wt%Sn-2.5wt%nBCP composite is a promising candidate for the development of orthopedic implants.\n",

            "The basic properties of calcium phosphate cement (CPC) containing atelocollagen, the main component of the organic substrate in bone, were studied in an initial evaluation for the fabrication of modified CPC. The setting time of conventional CPC (c-CPC) was prolonged to over 100 min when c-CPC contained 1% or more atelocollagen. The diametral tensile strength (DTS) of c-CPC decreased linearly with the collagen content, descending to below the detection limit when the c-CPC contained 3% or more atelocollagen. Therefore, use of c-CPC as the base cement seems inappropriate for the fabrication of atelocollagen-containing CPC. In contrast, the cement set at 9-34 min when fast-setting CPC (FSCPC) was used as the base cement and contained 1-5% atelocollagen, respectively. Although addition of atelocollagen resulted in the decrease of DTS of the set mass, the DTS was approximately the same, 6-8 MPa, at contents of atelocollagen between 1% and 5%. When atelocollagen was added to FSCPC, the handling property was improved significantly. The paste also became more adhesive with increase in atelocollagen content. These properties are desirable for its use in surgical procedures since, for example, bony defects can be filled easily and without a space interposed between the bone and cement paste. Although there are some disadvantages for the addition of atelocollagen to CPC, it can be accepted as long as FSCPC was used as the base cement. We conclude that further evaluations of the effects of atelocollagen, such as biocompatibility, bone synthesis, and bone replacement behaviour should be done, using FSCPC as the base cement.

The CaP coating was applied using an integrated electrospinning and rapid heating and cooling (EMRHC) process. The residual stress over half and full done EMRHC process was measured by x-ray method. The substrate and coatings were characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscope equipped with the energy-dispersive spectroscope, Vicker's microhardness, atomic force microscopy, and x-ray diffractometer techniques. It was found that the preliminary hydroxyapatite on the Ti substrate was exchanged with alpha-TCP, CaO, TiO2, CaTiO3, and Ti5P3 over the EMRHC process. The results also showed that the tensile + 591 +/- 89 and compressive - 189 +/- 42 MPa residual stress remained on the surface over the half and full done EMRHC process, respectively. The hardness, Young module, and ultimate tensile strength of both samples were enhanced significantly by the EMRHC process. The tribology of samples was comprehensibly evaluated in a dry and simulated body fluid solution. The CaP coating prepared by the full-EMRHC process showed the lowest wear rates in comparison with the others due to the compressive residual stress. The coefficient of friction of CPTi coated by EMRHC was significantly reduced when exposed to the SBF solution. Our findings revealed that EMRHC is a promising method to fabricate the Ti implant with higher mechanical properties.\n",

Passive current densities of the HNS in all electrolytes were lower than those of 316L. Therefore, the HNS shows higher passivity and resistance to pitting corrosion than 316L. The passive current density in Hanks of HNS was lower than that in saline, indicating that the protectiveness of surface oxide film increased with the existence of inorganic ions such as phosphate and calcium ions. On the other hand, the passive current density in E-MEM was higher than that in Hanks, but was lower than that in saline.

            "Magnesium alloys are potential biodegradable materials for biomedical application. But their poor corrosion resistance may result in premature failure of implants. In this study, to solve this problem, Ca-P coatings were prepared on ZK60 magnesium alloy by a simple chemical conversion process and heat treatment. Surface characterization showed that a flake-like Dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) (CaHPO42H2O) coating was formed on ZK60 alloy by the chemical conversion process. DCPD transformed into Dicalcium phosphate anhydrous (DCPa) (CaHPO4) and Ca2P2O7 after heat treatment. Results of potentiodynamic polarization showed the corrosion potential of ZK60 was increased from -1666mV to -1566mV with DCPD coating, while -1515mV was obtained after heat treatment. The corrosion current density of ZK60 was measured to be reduced from 35 mu A/cm(2) to 3.5 mu A/cm(2) with DCPD coating, while a further reduction to 1 mu A/cm(2) was observed after heat treatment. This indicated that the coatings improved the substrate corrosion resistance significantly, and apparently, the heat-treated coating had a higher corrosion resistance. Immersion test demonstrated that both the coatings could provide protection for the substrate and the heat-treated coating could induce deposition of bone-like apatite. Cytotoxicity evaluation revealed that none of the samples induced toxicity to L-929 cells after 1- and 3-day culture. The cytocompatibility of ZK60 was improved by the coatings, with the following sequence: uncoated ZK60\n",
